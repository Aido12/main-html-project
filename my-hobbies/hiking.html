  Hiking is a long, vigorous walk, usually on person hikingtrails or footpaths
  in the countryside. Walking for pleasure developed in Europe during the
  eighteenth century.[1] Religious pilgrimages have existed much longer but they
  involve walking long distances for a spiritual purpose associated with
  specific religions.
